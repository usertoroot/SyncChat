**Privacy Policy for YourEnd2End Chat**

*Last updated: June 15, 2025*

**1. No Personal Data Collection**

* We don’t ask for your name, email address, phone number or any other identifying information.
* The app generates a random encryption key-pair (public and private keys) on your device. Only the public key ever leaves your phone, and even that is only used to route messages.

**2. What We Do Collect (and Why)**

* **Public Keys.** To connect peers, we use your randomly generated public key as an anonymous identifier.
* **Routing Metadata.** Brief, encrypted headers (e.g. “who to send to next”) are used only to relay messages; they contain no message content and are discarded immediately after delivery.

**3. How We Use Your Data**

* We match incoming encrypted streams to the correct recipient purely by their public key.
* No one at YourEnd2End Chat (including us!) can decrypt or read your messages—ever.
* We do **not** store chat logs, message contents, contact lists, or IP addresses beyond what’s strictly necessary for real-time delivery.

**4. End-to-End Encryption**

* All messages, voice, and file transfers are encrypted on your device and decrypted only on the recipient’s device.
* The encryption keys never leave your devices, so even if data were intercepted, it remains unreadable.

**5. Data Retention & Deletion**

* Routing headers and public-key associations persist only for the brief moment required to forward your message.
* Once a message is delivered (or fails), all associated metadata is purged.

**6. Your Control & Rights**

* You can delete the app at any time to remove any remaining local keys or cache.
* Because we never hold personal data or message content, there’s nothing for us to disclose or share.

**7. Updates to This Policy**

* If we change how we handle data, we’ll announce an update here with the date.

**In short:** We collect nothing that identifies you, we use only anonymous public keys to connect peers, and we cannot—and do not—read your encrypted chats.
